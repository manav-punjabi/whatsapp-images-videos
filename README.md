# whatsapp-images-videos
this simple program let's you send photos and videos to any unsaved number in your contacts
things to keep in mind if you are using whatsapp web instead of a desktop app your pos2 variable may vary according to at what position is your attachment icon
i have provided a positions.py file which will return postions of a point if the cursor is on that point you can use that to figure pos2 for your work
